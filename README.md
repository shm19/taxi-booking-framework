## Framework Architecture

The framework is designed using a service oriented architecture with each service using a layered architecture, with a focus on scalability and adaptability.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1000" src="images/Project-Architecture.png" alt="Project Architecture">
</p>

### Framework Services:

#### [Booking Service](portal/framework/src/main/java/com/taxi/framework/booking)

> Handles bookings made by users, manages assignments, states of the user, and assigned driver's location.

#### [Dispatching Service](portal/framework/src/main/java/com/taxi/framework/dispatch)

> Handles finding users based on proximity to the driver, using the locations from fleet management.

#### [Fleet Management Service](portal/framework/src/main/java/com/taxi/framework/fleet)

> Handles drivers registered and looking for users, keeps an updated location of each driver.

#### [Pricing Service](portal/framework/src/main/java/com/taxi/framework/pricing)

> Handles pricing calculation for a user based on different variables like traffic, rain, and distance.

#### [User Service](portal/framework/src/main/java/com/taxi/framework/user)

> Pre-made endpoints, DTOs, and service interface for user management.

## Component, and Class Diagram

To view the enforced architecture diagram please check the UML.drawio file inside the repository (The classes provided by the framework are colored blue, while the classes that are supposed to be made by the developer are coloured purple).

### Connect database

```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE taxi;

-- Connect to the taxi database
\c taxi;

-- Create user_logs table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
